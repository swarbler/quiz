# revisionio 📝

a very simple program I made so you can do some multiple choice questions on various subjects and topics

## What is it? 

revisionio is a text-based program where you can revise subjects by doing simple multiple-choice questions. It currently includes most of my IGCSE elective subjects

## How To Run 🏃

You can run revisionio using two methods:

- Download exe produced by pyinstaller from the releases page
- Download the source code and run the Python file

⚠️ **NOTE: DATA FOLDER IS REQUIRED FOR REVISIONIO TO RUN, PLEASE DO NOT MODIFY OR DELETE IT** ⚠️
> the data folder must be in the same directory as the exe!

## Feature List 

- ability to select different subjects and topics
- shows you correct answer for a few seconds (default: 3) if you get a question wrong
- pop-up images using your default image viewer
  - useful for physics and chemistry questions that require diagrams
- different messages appear depending on your score
- records your previous score for each topic
- records your personal best for each topic
- settings to customise revisionio
  - change how long answer is shown in seconds (default: 3)
  - change input selector (default: '~~>')
  - toggle sfx (default: off)
  - toggle whether previous score is saved (default: on)
    - you could turn this off if you find being reminded of your previous score a bit annoying
    - note: personal best score is always saved

### Buggy 🐛

- sound effects (generated using sfxr)
  - for some reason playing sfx crashes the program randomly, so it's disabled by default

### to be added

- short answer questions (i.e. single word or phrase)
- structured questions (i.e. essay)
- more score messages
- ability to adjust wackiness of score messages (professional -> insane)
- additional revision tools?

## Included Subjects
